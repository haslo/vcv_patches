All of these patches are mine. You're free to dissect and analyse them as you please, and you also may reuse parts and concepts of the patches, as long as you change them enough to make them sound noticeably different.

I do however reserve the rights to redistribute or (re)publish them. So other than the above granted rights, the usual exclusive copyright applies. The reason for that is, I want to avoid any trouble with ContentID or anything anywhere.
